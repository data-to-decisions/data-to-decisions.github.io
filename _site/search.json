(intuition first)\nCo-observability answers:\n\nCan a team of local supervisors, each with partial observations, collectively make correct control decisions — without a central observer?\n\nKey ideas: - No single agent is observable - Decisions are made locally - Correctness must hold globally\nIf observability is: &gt; “One observer can see enough”\nThen co-observability is: &gt; “Even if no one sees enough alone, together they can still act correctly”"
