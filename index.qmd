## A research studio for decision-making under uncertainty

**Data to Decisions Studio** develops theory and open-source tools at the intersection of **control**, **optimisation**, **networks**, **learning**, and **AI**, with an emphasis on **risk-aware** and **trustworthy** deployment in physical and cyber-physical systems.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Focus:** turning uncertain data and learned models into **robust decisions** with quantifiable performance and safety.

### Distance between stochastic dynamical systems
A technical framework to quantify **model discrepancy** between stochastic systems in a way that supports robustness reasoning and downstream decision-making.

- Clear problem formulation and metric structure  
- Links between frequency- and time-domain viewpoints  
- Computational pathways and illustrative examples
